# Java
To run a Java program from source, first you need to compile it into bytecode. Let's take the HelloWorld.java file in this project as an example.

If you have access to a command line and a Java compiler (I'm assuming you're using the official JDK), you should be able to run the following command:

```
javac HelloWorld.java
```

That takes the code file, HelloWorld.java, as input and outputs the bytecode compiled version as a file called HelloWorld.class.

Then, to run the program, just run the following command:

```
java HelloWorld
```
